# Research abstract 
This study investigates the impact of parental food supplementation on provisioning behavior and breeding success in Arctic-breeding Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius) over five successive breeding seasons (2013-2017). The experiment aimed to assess the influence of food supplementation on provisioning behavior, reproductive success, and offspring survival, exploring three potential models: additive, substitution, and insurance. The results reveal that supplemental feeding significantly increased offspring survival probability, supporting both additive and insurance models. However, there was no evidence of changes in provisioning effort or fledgling body condition, challenging the predictions of these models. The study suggests a hybrid of the additive and substitution models, where food supplementation may enable increased investment in other forms of parental care, such as nest defence, without altering provisioning rates. The lack of observed effects on provisioning rates, coupled with increased survival, suggests a potential reallocation of parental effort. The findings contribute to understanding the nuanced responses of Peregrine falcons to food supplementation, highlighting the need for future studies to explore broader environmental contexts and potential long-term effects on parental survival and future reproduction.
